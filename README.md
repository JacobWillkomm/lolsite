# LoL Site

Another league of legends match history and stats site.

# Ideas

* Add user comments to matches.
    * Allow any user to comment, but highlight comments from
    users that actually played in the game.
    * This will most likely welcome post game toxicity, but I think it will be fun, too.
    * Need to add verified user accounts to allow this to become a reality.

- [x] Open summoner page links in a new tab.
- [x] Show winrates with friends
- [x] Show overall played with stats

- [ ] Add multisearch functionality
- [x] carry score

    * apply player ranks to participant data
