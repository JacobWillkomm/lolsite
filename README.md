### Some Docs
* [Installation](/docs/installation.md)
* [Deployment](/docs/deployment.md)


# LoL Site

Another league of legends match history and stats site.

# Ideas

* Add user comments to matches.
    * Allow any user to comment, but highlight comments from
    users that actually played in the game.
    * This will most likely welcome post game toxicity, but I think it will be fun, too.
    * Need to add verified user accounts to allow this to become a reality.

* Open summoner page links in a new tab.
* Show winrates with friends
* Show overall played with stats


# Other Technical Information

Take a look at [techspec.md](techspec.md) for more information on how the site is ticking.
